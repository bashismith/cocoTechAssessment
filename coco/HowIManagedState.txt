Hello Coco Team,

For this project I chose to manage state via react hooks in order to keep state more intuitive and localized to the functional components that are utilizing said state. I also chose to utilize react hooks rather than redux in order to avoid extensive boilerplate set up in best interest for quick deplyoment.
